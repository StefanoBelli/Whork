\subsection{Aim of the document}

design diagrams and storyboards.
\subsection{Overview of the defined system}
Whork is an easy to use job-seeking platform. It allows job seekers to find and candidate for a job based on their interests, with direct interaction such as
chatting with recruiter who posted a particular offer, immediate candidacy, on-sight workplace location map and only some other really useful details: no waste of time with useless infos.
Provides user-friendly job offer posting feature for company recruiters. Lets company admin able to manage recruiters by providing
a simple control panel in their own private profile. This system also ensures that company whose signing up is a valid one and we also mark
valid and secure offers with a \dquote{Verified by Whork} signature. Also, as previously said, a reliable chatting platform is built-in Whork, which can be used from recruiters to chat with
anyone who tries to reach them (by seeing their \dquote{inbox} in own private profile), job seekers can get in touch with recruiter easily, just by pressing a button. Company admins and recruiters
can see general stats about their recruiting operations, like number of clicks on offers, number of posted offers, how many offers some recruiter posted, candidate employment status, and so on...
\subsection{Operational settings}
This system runs on whatever operating sytstem/architecture supports a java runtime environment.\\
 Fully works on Java JRE 11 or higher.
