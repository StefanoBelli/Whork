\section{User stories}
Various user stories are collected here:
\begin{itemize}

	\item As a company, I want to manage my interview calendar,

		distance for me, so that I can easily get to the workplace. 
	\item As a recruiter for a video game company, I want to get a shared editor 
		to test programmers’ skills and save their on-the-fly work, so that 
		I can analyze it better later.
	\item As a company, I want to analyze social profiles of candidates, 
		so that I can define their profile.
	\item As a company, I want to read the freelancers‘ CV, 
		so that I can choose the most experienced.

		requirements, so that I can easily find better employees.

\section{Functional requirements}
The following are functional requirements for the project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system shall provide the ability to display a calendar for time management.
	\item The system shall notify you by email of new offers from a favorite company.
	\item The system shall provide the possibility to search based on the user's interest using advanced search filters.
	\item The system shall provide all users with a search filter to decide whether to seek a
	"part time job" or a "full time job".
	\item The system shall force every user to login before looking at their personalized “main page”.
	\item The system shall facilitate the hiring process for companies, so it is required that after ending a session, 
	the interviewer has the possibility to hire or reject the candidate (with no expiration time).
	\item The system shall provide all users with an upload curriculum feature in their profile.
	\item The system shall provide all companies with a job posting function
	\footnote{title, description, salary (optional), map, topic, type of contract, working hours, educational qualification}.
	\item The system shall sort job offers based on salary (descending order) on the search page.
\end{itemize}
